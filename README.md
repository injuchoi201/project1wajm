Combat Injury Visual Descriptor

Combat Injury Visual Descriptor (CIVD) is a deep learning-based system that generates descriptive medical reports from images of battlefield injuries. The goal is to support combat medics by providing fast, accurate, and structured injury descriptions in high-stress field conditions.

Project Overview

Combat medics often face extreme pressure, limited visibility, and time-critical decisions. Our model is designed to:

- Analyze real-time images of injuries

- Generate concise, medically relevant descriptions

- Aid in faster triage and decision-making on the battlefield

This tool could be used in:

- HUDs (Heads-Up Displays)

- Remote triage systems

- Autonomous medical drones

About Us

We are Computer Science students from Yonsei University and Cornell University, collaborating on this project to bridge AI and military medicine. This work is inspired by real challenges faced by service members in the field, with the goal of creating technology that improves frontline medical care.

Technologies Used

- Python

- PyTorch or TensorFlow

- OpenCV

- Vision-Language Models (e.g., BLIP, CLIP, Flamingo)

- FastAPI or Flask (for API deployment)

- Docker (optional for deployment)

Disclaimer

This project is a research prototype and is not intended for real medical diagnosis or treatment. Images used must comply with ethical and legal standards. Further validation is required before any real-world use.
